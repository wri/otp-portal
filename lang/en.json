  "layer.integrated-alerts.metadata.overview": "<p> This dataset, assembled by Global Forest Watch, aggregates deforestation alerts from three alert systems (GLAD-L, GLAD-S2, RADD) into a single, integrated deforestation alert layer. This integration allows users to detect deforestation events faster than any single system alone, as the integrated layer is updated when any of the source alert systems are updated. </p> <p> The source alert systems are derived from satellites of varying spectral and spatial resolutions. 30m GLAD Landsat-based alerts are up-sampled to match the 10m spatial resolution of Sentinel-based alerts (GLAD-S2, RADD). This avoids the double counting of overlapping alerts, which are instead classified at a higher confidence level, indicated by darker pixels. </p> <p> Alerts are classified as high confidence when detected twice by a single alert system. This can occur in areas and at times when only one alert system was operating. Where multiple alert systems are operating, alerts detected by multiple (two or three) of these systems are classified as highest confidence. With multiple sensors picking up change in the same location, we can be more confident that an alert was not a false positive and do not need to wait for additional satellite imagery to increase confidence in detected loss, thus providing more confident alerting faster than with a single system. </p>",

  "layer.tree-cover-gain.metadata.overview": "<p> This data set from the GLAD (Global Land Analysis & Discovery) lab at the University of Maryland measures areas of tree cover gain from the year 2000 to 2020 across the globe at 30 × 30 meter resolution, displayed as a 20-year cumulative layer. Tree cover gain was determined using tree height information from the years 2000 and 2020. Tree height was modeled by the integration of the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar forest structure measurements and Landsat analysis-ready data time-series. The NASA GEDI is a spaceborne lidar instrument operating onboard the International Space Station since April 2019. It provides point-based measurements of vegetation structure, including forest canopy height at latitudes between 52°N and 52°S globally. Gain was identified where pixels had tree height ≥5 m in 2020 and tree height <5 m in 2000. </p> <p> Tree cover gain may indicate a number of potential activities, including natural forest growth, the tree crop rotation cycle, or tree plantation management. </p> <p> When zoomed out (< zoom level 12), pixels of gain are shaded according to the density of gain at the 30 x 30 meter scale. Pixels with darker shading represent areas with a higher concentration of tree cover gain, whereas pixels with lighter shading indicate a lower concentration of tree cover gain. There is no variation in pixel shading when the data is at full resolution (≥ zoom level 12). </p>",

  "layer.tree-cover-loss.metadata.disclaimer": "Tree cover loss <span class='highlight'>is not always deforestation</span>.",
  "layer.tree-cover-loss.metadata.disclaimer-tooltip": "Loss of tree cover may occur for many reasons, including deforestation, fire, and logging within the course of sustainable forestry operations. In sustainably managed forests, the “loss” will eventually show up as “gain”, as young trees get large enough to achieve canopy closure.",
  "layer.tree-cover-loss.metadata.overview": "\"In this data set, “tree cover” is defined as all vegetation greater than 5 meters in height, and may take the form of natural forests or plantations across a range of canopy densities. “Loss” indicates the removal or mortality of tree cover and can be due to a variety of factors, including mechanical harvesting, fire, disease, or storm damage. As such, “loss” does not equate to deforestation.\n\nDue to variation in research methodology and date of content, tree cover, loss, and gain data sets cannot be compared accurately against each other. Accordingly, “net” loss cannot be calculated by subtracting figures for tree cover gain from tree cover loss, and current (post-2000) tree cover cannot be determined by subtracting figures for annual tree cover loss from year 2000 tree cover.\n\nThe 2011-2022 data was produced using updated methodology: https://storage.googleapis.com/earthenginepartners-hansen/GFC-2022-v1.10/download.html. Comparisons between the original 2001-2010 data and the 2011-2022 update should be performed with caution.\n\nThe authors evaluated the overall prevalence of false positives (commission errors) in this data at 13%, and the prevalence of false negatives (omission errors) at 12%, though the accuracy varies by biome and thus may be higher or lower in any particular location. The model often misses disturbances in smallholder landscapes, resulting in lower accuracy of the data in sub-Saharan Africa, where this type of disturbance is more common. The authors are 75 percent confident that the loss occurred within the stated year, and 97 percent confident that it occurred within a year before or after. Users of the data can smooth out such uncertainty by examining the average over multiple years.",
